To start playing click on the game tab and either start a new game or load a current save.

On the dungeon screen, click on the button of the direction you would like to go in.
Sometimes areas will only have one choice, but you can always head back to previous rooms to train up.
Each area has a number of rooms you must progress FORWARD through to reach the boss at the end of each area.
Once you beat a boss you will unlock the next area if you haven't already. 
Also in the game tab, you can always go back to previous areas and face the enemies in that area.

In the battle screen, you must select the target you would like to attack.
Your allies do not follow the target you are targeting and to confirm your attack choice,
you must push the attack button of the attack you would like to do.
The display of the AI attacks is shown below and you can change that delay from 1 second to 10 seconds to suit your style
Beware some attacks require a certain amount of energy depending on your level.
You can also focus attacks and gain bonuses on your attacks using energy based on your level.
You will gain up to 10% of your max energy at the end of each of your turns(using a potion counts as your turn)
You will gain exp each time you defeat an enemy, but you will only gain the loot if you win the battle.

If you lose a battle you will be forced to start back at the beginning of the area.
If you win you will be able to continue on the track you are currently going.
Each time you defeat a boss room, you will gain a special bonus.

Can you beat all the bosses?
